## Solutions to Try

### Solution 1: Verify Repository Creation
1. Go to: https://github.com/Maksudur20
2. Check if you see "Task_Analyzer" in your repositories list

7. Click "Create repository"

### Solution 3: Use GitHub's Upload Interface  
1. Go to your repository page after creation
2. Look for "uploading an existing repository from the command line" 
3. Follow those exact commands

### Solution 4: Manual File Upload
1. Create the repository (Solution 2)
2. Use GitHub's web interface "Add file" -> "Upload files"
