## Git Repository Setup - Final Solution

### The Problem
- Original repository (Sium20/Task_Analyzer) cannot be forked because it's empty
- Need to create your own repository to store your working code

### The Solution
**Step 1: Create Repository on GitHub**
1. Go to: https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `Task_Analyzer`
3. Description: `ASP.NET Core Task Management System - Fixed Database Issues`
4. Make it Public (recommended)
5. **IMPORTANT**: Leave ALL checkboxes UNCHECKED:
   - ❌ Add a README file
   - ❌ Add .gitignore
   - ❌ Choose a license
6. Click "Create repository"

**Step 2: After Creating Repository**
Tell me "repository created" and I'll push your code!

### What Will Happen Next
1. I'll push your working Task Analyzer code to your new repository
2. You'll have full control over your repository
3. Your database fixes and working application will be safely stored on GitHub

### Authentication
When pushing, you'll need:
- Username: `Maksudur20`
- Password: `[Your Personal Access Token]` (create at https://github.com/settings/tokens)

### Current Status
✅ Local repository configured
✅ Remote URL set to: https://github.com/Maksudur20/Task_Analyzer.git
✅ Git credentials configured
✅ Application working with fixed database
⏳ Waiting for GitHub repository creation
