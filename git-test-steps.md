# Git Authentication Test Steps

## When you're ready to push:

1. **Update remote URL** (replace with your actual repository):
   ```
   git remote set-url origin https://github.com/Maksudur20/Task_Analyzer.git
   ```

2. **Test connection**:
   ```
   git remote -v
   ```

3. **Push changes**:
   ```
   git push origin main
   ```

4. **When prompted for credentials**:
   - Username: `Maksudur20`
   - Password: `[Your Personal Access Token]` (NOT your GitHub password!)

## Troubleshooting:

- If it asks for credentials, use your GitHub username and the Personal Access Token
- If you get "repository not found", make sure the repository exists and the URL is correct
- If you get "permission denied", check that you have the right permissions or the token has correct scopes

## Success indicators:
- You should see: "Enumerating objects", "Counting objects", "Writing objects"
- Then: "Branch 'main' set up to track remote branch 'main' from 'origin'"
